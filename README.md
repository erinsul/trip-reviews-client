An app to record and rate places to visit.

Built with: Ruby on Rails, Ember.js

I focused my efforts on being able to create, edit,
show and delete a user's trips via a profile. I still need to continue to work
on being able to add tags to a trip.

Deployed app is here: https://erinsul.github.io/trip-reviews-client/

Back end repo is here: https://github.com/erinsul/trip-reviews-api
